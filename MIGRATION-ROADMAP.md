## 🎯 Core Architecture Principle

**Hybrid System: Use the right tool for each template.**

- **Template Format**: Node graphs OR HTML templates (explicit choice per template)
- **Rendering Format**: HTML (compiled from nodes OR direct HTML for Puppeteer)
- **HTML Templates**: First-class citizens (not deprecated, use for complex/long-format)
- **Node Graphs**: Use for simple posters, programmatic templates, Figma imports
- **Future**: Long-format content support (documents, multi-page layouts)

```

**Total Timeline**: 24 weeks (~6 months)
**Note**: Phase 2 is now optional - convert templates selectively based on need

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Build the core node graph system (start simple, extensible later)

**Philosophy**: Start with the minimum viable node graph system. Add advanced features in later phases.

### Tasks

- [x] Create `TemplateNode` interface (TypeScript types) ✅
  - [x] **Basic node types only** (start simple):
    - [x] Text nodes (basic: content, position, size, binding)
    - [x] Image nodes (basic: src, position, size, fit mode)
    - [x] Shape nodes (basic: rectangles, circles)
    - [x] Group nodes (basic: containers with children)
    - [x] Frame nodes (root container)
    - [x] Flex nodes (flexbox layout)
    - [x] Box nodes (block containers)
    - [x] SVG nodes (for masked images)
  - [ ] **Skip for now** (add later):
    - [ ] Advanced text properties (shadows, gradients, animations)
    - [ ] Advanced image properties (masks, focal points)
    - [ ] Complex shapes (paths, custom)
    - [ ] Video/chart nodes (add when needed)
- [x] Create `TemplateSchema` interface (core structure) ✅
  - [x] Node graph structure (tree-based)
  - [x] Basic variant override definitions (hide/show only)
  - [x] Basic token definitions (colors only - spacing/typography later)
  - [x] Basic binding definitions (simple field mappings)
  - [ ] **Skip for now** (add later):
    - [ ] Complex variant actions (animate, resize, recolor)
    - [ ] Advanced tokens (spacing, typography, shadows)
    - [ ] Complex bindings (computed, conditional, arrays)
- [x] Build node-to-HTML compiler (`lib/node-to-html-compiler-v2.ts`) ✅
  - [x] Converts node graph → HTML string
  - [x] Handles basic layout (absolute positioning)
  - [x] Handles flexbox layouts (FlexNode, BoxNode)
  - [x] Generates CSS for positioning
  - [x] Outputs HTML compatible with current Puppeteer pipeline
  - [ ] **Skip for now** (add later):
    - [ ] Grid layouts
    - [ ] Auto-flow layouts
    - [ ] Responsive breakpoints
- [x] Create dual-format template registry ✅
  - [x] Supports both node graphs and HTML (hybrid system)
  - [x] Detects template type automatically
  - [x] Routes to appropriate renderer
  - [x] Explicit format selection via config.json
- [x] Create node graph storage (database schema) ✅
  - [x] `Template` table with `format` field (node | html)
  - [x] `TemplateNode` table for node graphs
  - [x] Schema versioning (for future migrations)
  - [x] Migration path from HTML to nodes (converter exists)
- [x] Build schema registry (`lib/node-registry.ts`) ✅
- [x] Test compiler with sample node graph ✅
  - [x] Schema files created (schema.json, schema-layout-*.json)
  - [x] Test templates exist
- [x] Keep current HTML templates working (backwards compatibility) ✅

### Design Principles Applied

- ✅ **Optional properties** - All advanced features are optional
- ✅ **Union types** - Easy to add new node types later
- ✅ **Modular compiler** - Can add new compilation logic without breaking existing
- ✅ **Versioned schema** - Allows evolution over time

### Your Role

- [x] Review node graph structure (does it make sense for your designs?) ✅
- [x] Test that current HTML templates still work (no regression) ✅
- [x] Review compiler output (does HTML look correct?) ✅
- [x] Hybrid system implemented and working ✅
- [ ] **Don't worry about** advanced features yet (they'll come later)

### Deliverables

- ✅ **Core** node graph data structure (source of truth)
- ✅ **Basic** compiler that converts node graph → HTML (for Puppeteer)
- ✅ Dual-format support (nodes + legacy HTML)
- ✅ Current templates still work (no breaking changes)
- ✅ **Extensible foundation** (ready for future features)

### What's NOT Included (By Design)

**Intentionally skipped for Phase 1** (will be added in later phases):
- ❌ Advanced node properties (shadows, gradients, animations)
- ❌ Complex layouts (flexbox, grid, auto-flow)
- ❌ Advanced variant actions (beyond hide/show)
- ❌ Advanced tokens (beyond colors)
- ❌ Multi-page support (Phase 8)
- ❌ Video/chart nodes (add when needed)

**Why**: Start simple, prove the concept, extend later. This keeps Phase 1 focused and achievable.

### Status: 🟢 Complete (Hybrid system implemented)

  - [x] Preserves bindings (field mappings)
- [ ] Convert templates selectively (as needed)
  - [ ] Convert simple posters that benefit from node graphs
  - [ ] Keep HTML for complex/long-format templates
  - [ ] Test converted templates render identically
  - [ ] Visual comparison (pixel-perfect)
  - [ ] Functional comparison (all fields work)
- [x] Hybrid system supports both formats ✅

```

### Hybrid System Architecture

```
Template Registry
├── Node Graph Templates
│   ├── Source: Node graph (schema.json or schema-layout-*.json)
│   ├── Render: Compile to HTML → Puppeteer
│   ├── Status: First-class (use for simple posters, programmatic templates)
│   ├── Config: format: "node" in config.json
│   └── Features: Start simple, extend later
└── HTML Templates
    ├── Source: HTML file (template-*.html)
    ├── Render: Direct → Puppeteer
    ├── Status: First-class (use for complex/long-format content)
    └── Config: format: "html" or omit (defaults to HTML)
```

**Key Points**:
- Both formats are **first-class citizens** (not deprecated)
- Choose format per template based on needs
- Hybrid system routes to correct renderer automatically
- No forced migration - convert selectively

### Evolution Path

**Phase 1 (Simple)**:
- Basic node types (text, image, shape, group)
- Basic variants (hide/show)
- Basic tokens (colors)
- Basic compiler (absolute positioning)

**Later Phases (Extended)**:
- Advanced properties (shadows, gradients, animations)
- Advanced variants (move, resize, animate)
- Advanced tokens (spacing, typography)
- Advanced layouts (flexbox, grid, auto-flow)
- New node types (video, charts, etc.)
- Multi-page support (Phase 8)

# 🗺️ Migration Roadmap: Current System → Node-Based System

> **Copy this entire document into Notion** - It's formatted for Notion's markdown support

---

## 🎯 Core Architecture Principle

**Nodes are the source of truth. HTML is compiled output.**

- **Template Format**: Node graphs (from Figma/Illustrator or manually created)
- **Rendering Format**: HTML (compiled from nodes for Puppeteer)
- **Legacy Support**: HTML templates work temporarily during migration
- **Future**: Long-format content support (documents, multi-page layouts)

## 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Goal**: Build the core node graph system (start simple, extensible later)

**Philosophy**: Start with the minimum viable node graph system. Add advanced features in later phases.

### Tasks

- [ ] Create `TemplateNode` interface (TypeScript types)
  - [ ] **Basic node types only** (start simple):
    - [ ] Text nodes (basic: content, position, size, binding)
    - [ ] Image nodes (basic: src, position, size, fit mode)
    - [ ] Shape nodes (basic: rectangles, circles)
    - [ ] Group nodes (basic: containers with children)
  - [ ] **Skip for now** (add later):
    - [ ] Advanced text properties (shadows, gradients, animations)
    - [ ] Advanced image properties (masks, focal points)
    - [ ] Complex shapes (paths, custom)
    - [ ] Video/chart nodes (add when needed)
- [ ] Create `TemplateSchema` interface (core structure)
  - [ ] Node graph structure (tree-based)
  - [ ] Basic variant override definitions (hide/show only)
  - [ ] Basic token definitions (colors only - spacing/typography later)
  - [ ] Basic binding definitions (simple field mappings)
  - [ ] **Skip for now** (add later):
    - [ ] Complex variant actions (animate, resize, recolor)
    - [ ] Advanced tokens (spacing, typography, shadows)
    - [ ] Complex bindings (computed, conditional, arrays)
- [ ] Build node-to-HTML compiler (`lib/node-to-html-compiler.ts`)
  - [ ] Converts node graph → HTML string
  - [ ] Handles basic layout (absolute positioning)
  - [ ] Generates CSS for positioning
  - [ ] Outputs HTML compatible with current Puppeteer pipeline
  - [ ] **Skip for now** (add later):
    - [ ] Flexbox/grid layouts
    - [ ] Auto-flow layouts
    - [ ] Responsive breakpoints
- [ ] Create dual-format template registry
  - [ ] Supports both node graphs and legacy HTML
  - [ ] Detects template type automatically
  - [ ] Routes to appropriate renderer
- [ ] Create node graph storage (database schema)
  - [ ] `Template` table with `format` field (node | html)
  - [ ] `TemplateNode` table for node graphs
  - [ ] Schema versioning (for future migrations)
  - [ ] Migration path from HTML to nodes
- [ ] Build schema registry (`lib/schema-registry.ts`)
- [ ] Test compiler with sample node graph (simple test case)
- [ ] Keep current HTML templates working (backwards compatibility)

### Design Principles Applied

- ✅ **Optional properties** - All advanced features are optional
- ✅ **Union types** - Easy to add new node types later
- ✅ **Modular compiler** - Can add new compilation logic without breaking existing
- ✅ **Versioned schema** - Allows evolution over time

### Your Role

- [ ] Review node graph structure (does it make sense for your designs?)
- [ ] Test that current HTML templates still work (no regression)
- [ ] Review compiler output (does HTML look correct?)
- [ ] **Don't worry about** advanced features yet (they'll come later)
- [ ] Provide feedback on any UI changes

### Deliverables

- ✅ **Core** node graph data structure (source of truth)
- ✅ **Basic** compiler that converts node graph → HTML (for Puppeteer)
- ✅ Dual-format support (nodes + legacy HTML)
- ✅ Current templates still work (no breaking changes)
- ✅ **Extensible foundation** (ready for future features)

### What's NOT Included (By Design)

**Intentionally skipped for Phase 1** (will be added in later phases):
- ❌ Advanced node properties (shadows, gradients, animations)
- ❌ Complex layouts (flexbox, grid, auto-flow)
- ❌ Advanced variant actions (beyond hide/show)
- ❌ Advanced tokens (beyond colors)
- ❌ Multi-page support (Phase 8)
- ❌ Video/chart nodes (add when needed)

**Why**: Start simple, prove the concept, extend later. This keeps Phase 1 focused and achievable.

  - [ ] Store colors as `{ token: "primary" }` not `{ hex: "#3D9DFF" }`

## 🚦 Decision Points

### Decision 1: Cloud Storage Provider
**When**: Before Phase 6
**Options**: AWS S3 vs Cloudflare R2
**Considerations**:
- Cost (R2 is cheaper, no egress fees)
- Integration (both work with Vercel)
- Performance (both are fast)
**Decision Needed By**: Week 16

### Decision 2: Figma Plugin Approach
**When**: Before Phase 3
**Options**: 
- Full-featured plugin (more work, better UX)
- Simple export tool (less work, manual mapping)
**Recommendation**: Start simple, enhance later
**Decision Needed By**: Week 6

### Decision 3: Illustrator Import Method
**When**: During Phase 3
**Options**:
- SVG export → parse (recommended)
- PDF export → parse
- Native .ai parsing (complex, not recommended)
**Recommendation**: SVG export (most reliable)
**Decision Needed By**: Week 10

### Decision 4: Job Queue System
**When**: Before Phase 7
**Options**:
- Simple database queue (easier, good for start)
- External queue service (more scalable, Redis/BullMQ)
**Recommendation**: Start with database queue, upgrade if needed
**Decision Needed By**: Week 17

### Decision 5: Long-Format Rendering
**When**: Before Phase 8
**Options**:
- Puppeteer multi-page (current stack)
- PDFKit (more control, different stack)
- Keep Puppeteer, enhance for documents
**Recommendation**: Enhance Puppeteer (consistency)
**Decision Needed By**: Week 20
